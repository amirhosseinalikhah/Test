<ul>
<li>Supernode should holds more than 500,000 coins.</li>
<li>Supernode silent locking time is 90 days.</li>
<li>Supernodes must maintain full accounts and participate in mining.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>How to become a supernode?</b></h2>

<p>1. Download and run the TrustNote Supernode client;</p>

<p>3. Pays sufficient amount of TTT to the contract to support the crowdfunding method to pay the Supernode deposit, but the coinbase allocation rules need to be developed by the crowdfunding sponsor;</p>

<p>4. In accordance with TR-02 TrustME-PoW, the supernode participates in mining and obtains coinbase rewards, in addition to receive additional TFans rewards;</p>

<p>5. If one doen't want to be supernode anymore, the supernode needs wait untill the end of silent locking time in which it is not allowed to participate in mining;</p>

<p>6. Once the silent locking time finished the supernode can reimburse the deposit to the assigned address.</p>

<h2><b>4.2 SuperNode Rights</b></h2>

<h2><b>4.3 Minign reward rules</b></h2>

<p>The total mining reward is 500,000,000,000 TTT, and the mining lasts 20 years. The calculation formula of the ratio of mining output to the total mining reward in the i<sup>th</sup> year:</p>

<div align="center">
<math>b = &sum; r<sub>i</sub> Ã— n<sub>i</sub></math>
</div>

<p>The distribution ratio of mining output is as follows:</p>

| 80% | miners |

<p>According [TrustNote-TR-2018-02 The TrustME-PoW Consensus Scheme](https://github.com/trustnote/document/blob/master/TrustNote-TR-2018-02.md), supernode receives the Attestion power by taking part in PoW rounds, in each round 10 Attestors will be selecetd, also two fixed attestors will be added to the list once the 8<sup>th</sup> is selcetd by the PoW competitation.</p>

<h2><b>4.4 Supernode TFans Ranking Reward Rules</b></h2>

<p>The purpose of the Supernode TFans Rewards setting is to reward super nodes that support TrustNote for a long time.</p>

<p>Supernodes do not acquire TFans during mining, but TFans can be collected in other ways.</p>

<p>The TrustNote Foundation counts all super nodes that have obtained Attestation power every month, calculates the number of TFans in their deposit contract, and ranks them according to the number of TFans of the supernodes. The top 10 can get the supernode TFans reward. The supernode TFans reward distribution is as follows:</p>

<div align="center">

| <b>Rank</b> | <b>Portion</b> |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1	| 15.36% |
| 2	| 12.48% |
| 3	| 11.05% |
| 4	| 10.13% |
| 5	| 9.48% |
| 6	| 8.97% |
| 7	| 8.57% |
| 8	| 8.23% |
| 9	| 7.94% |
| 10	| 7.70% |

</div>

<p>Note: The portions in the table above will be reduced by 0.01%, which is used as the processing fee.</p>

<li>SuperNode deposit management and Coinbase reward distribution are automatically done by the TrustNote 2.0 program and do not require operational operations.</li>
<li>Super node TFans ranking, address and rewards will be displayed in the explorer and automatically archived every month and can export the TFans ranking reward table as well.</li>
<li>Technical requirements: Browser development area is used to display the total number of supernodes and supernode TFans ranking, TFans ranking reward background, batch coinage tool</li>
<li>Operational process:</li>
  <ul>
<li>i. The browser archives the TFans ranking results of the supernodes for the last month at the beginning of each month.</li>
<li>ii. Operators export last month's ranking results and rewards distribution schedules from the TFans ranking rewards field at the beginning of each month</li>
<li>iii. Operators review schedule</li>
<li>iv. Operators use batch tools to complete rewards transfers</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Lottery</b></h1>

<li>The gameplay is similar to the big lottery</li>

<li>The result of the lottery is the last 4 bits of the main chain single hash value of n consecutive MCIs starting at 12 noon every day (a total of n 4 bit numbers).</li>

<li>Each note is 2 TTT or 2000 TFans, and the funds enter the bonus pool.</li>

<li>Technical requirements: wallet activity page, bot, lottery program, batch coinage program</li>

<li>Operational process:</li>
<ul>
<li>i. The user should load the wallet activity page: interacts with the bot to get the bet address, selects the number and bets.</li>
<li>ii. The bots summarize the betting situation in each period.</li>
<li>iii. The pre-recruitment activity page is locked, and the bot aggregates the betting status of each period, including the address and bet number.</li>
