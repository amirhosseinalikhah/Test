<b>Abstract</b>
<p>Today’s blockchain technologies face many challenges such as network congestion, high transaction fees, and long transaction confirmation delay.  TrustNote seeks to address these problems by building the world-leading public Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger which is minable, capable of handling high concurrent transactions yet still maintain quick transaction confirmation.  TrustNote is focused on creating an easy-to-use, decentralized, low-level digital token blockchain that leverages declarative Smart Contracts with enhanced expression capability, while empowering users to create and publish digital tokens without having to write complex Smart Contracts.  TrustNote has an extensible wallet that provides security and rich API interfaces for digital tokens, blockchain games and social networks, which allowing new innovative ideas to run smoothly on the blockchain network and making user friendly blockchain applications accessible to everyone.  TrustNote has an innovative two-tier consensus mechanism and the TrustME consensus algorithms.  These algorithms are working by selecting a number of Super Nodes periodically to act as attestation authorities which they receive mining rewards according to amount of their validated attestations.</p>
